Interactive timeline of band gigs generated semi-automatically from YouTube videos

The idea is to make a sort of interactive timeline+map+video viewer for of all the appearances posted on YouTube of my current favorite band (The Leisure Society). 

## Possible features:
  * Entries filterable by song, location (specific, or country), date range (or year/month), event, etc. 
  * Add videos automatically by search terms (or suggest videos to add)
  * Feature to reject duplicates
  * Color-code by type of item? (Show, music video, official video, ...)
  * Automatically parse/scrape information on date and location from YouTube video title, description, etc.

## To do:
  * Choose database (MongoDB or MySQL or PostgreSQL recommended on Quora for web apps)
  * Choose framework for web frontend
  * Design interface
